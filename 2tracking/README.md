P2: Inference in DBNs
=====================

Exact Inference
---------------

Done.

Particle Filter
---------------

Also done.

Sidenote
--------

Check out the code and the bottom of `inference.py`
It modifies the built in `collections.Counter` class to include the methods you
would want.

This would probably be much better performant if you were actually building this
out, rather than implementing your own `util.Counter`.
